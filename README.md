## About

A collection of front end resources, tutorials, codepens and articles

Go to <a href="https://frontendwiz.co.uk/" target="_blank">website</a> where you can bookmark the links **without** making an account!

This project started of as nothing but a simple `README.md` file full of links I quite liked. It became way more popular than I thought it would so I made it into a webapp. That webapp was my first ever React project, and as you would expect, it was pretty (very) bad.

So now at v3 of the webapp and a fresh build I have made it beautiful again. React + TypeScript and its own API. Get to the site and check it out!

## Updates

Links are added at random but frequently! I basically use this website as my bookmarks bar so expect it to have lots very quickly!
